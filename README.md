#Stock Analysis
##Overview
This analysis is being done on the stock market over the years to hel Steve fine the best stock for his parents. Using VBA I created a code to show us which stocks did the best over which years. This will help Steve figure out which stock his parents should put their money into. 

##Results
When we run the code it will show us stocks for whichever year you enter into the popup box. This will calculate weather the stocks lost or gained monoey and by how much. We can see that the stocks in 2017 did much better than 2018 in the images below.
